Important:
The game was designed to be played on a 1920x1080 display, if the game is opened on a larger monitor it will just take a small proportion of the screen, if opened on a smaller display the game will not be 100% on the screen and some functions will be missing.

Start menu
The default grid size is 24x12 and mine proportion to grid squares is 0.2 or 20%, you can see that information in the top right corner of the start menu.

You can start the game without changing settings; however, if you close the start menu abruptly the setup file will be blank and you won't be able to run the Minesweeper game manually. If it is the case you need to run the game through the start menu.

Minesweeper
Please don't click on the mines more than once, if you do that will mess up the mine counter.
Please don't try to press left and right click at the same time, if left then right mouse buttons are clicked almost simultaneously then something not intended (given taught for) happens
Left click on a square if you think there isn't a mine, right click on a square if you think there is a mine.

In my version of the game, it is not possible to improperly flag a square, if you try to, a mistake is added and you can continue paying the game.

White squares are squares with 0 mines adjacent to it, if you left click on one its adjacent squares are revealed for convenience purposes, but it does not reveal the whole white area (area of squares with no adjacent mines). Sorry for that, I made 2 versions that tried to do that but with one I couldn't make it not go out of range and the other was too slow, made the game feel laggy, made the user wait. That way not allowing the game to be played in a normal pace.

I have not added the functionality that reveals adjacent unrevealed squares if you press on a revealed square that has the necessary amount of mines revealed.

The first few moves aren't guaranteed to be correct, therefore you might get some unnecessary mistakes in the first few moves. If you want to you can easily reset the game by pressing the reset button. It is never guaranteed that it is possible to think through the game using logic, so depending on the chosen game difficulty and random luck you might have to make some educated guesses.

But don't bee too quick, the game is simple, but it often can be logically continued even thought it might seem impossible at first.

The game is practically impossible to win with 0 mistakes when played on higher difficulties, when playing on them the game can be scored like golf, the lower number of mistakes the better.

Tip:
At the end of the game, when there are a only few squares left, it might seem like there is no way to figure out the mine locations; however, often the last few mine locations can be figured out using the mine counter.
